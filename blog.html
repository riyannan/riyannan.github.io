              <h2> Day in the Life </h2>
            <h3> By The Beatles </h3>
            <p><u>The Song</u></p>
            <p>Day in the Life starts off where the last song on the reord, "Sgt Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band", leaves off. Then a slew of piano comes in. </p>
    <p> The first verse is sang by John Lennon. He coveres a few tragic and/or dynamic events that had recently occured. He speaks about them from an outsider's </p>
            <p> perspective, almost tongue-in cheek. The highlight of this song is the orchestra. Reportedly, Lennon had instructed them to make it sound like the world </p>
            <p> was ending. Hence, the existential undertone. When the second verse comes in, Paul opens with a much cheerier tone. But, similar to the first verse, it</p>
            <p> ends with the orchestral boom. There are several elements of this song that make it my favorite, but the most important one is the sheer experimentation</p>
            <p> that is used. Every line in the song is utilized and perfectly executed. It has an undertone of fear and the unknown, but is also oddly cheery. </p>
  
            <p><u>The Band</u></p>
            <p>The infamous Beatles were "banded" (; together in Liverpool, England through a course of events that can only be described as destiny.</p>
            <p>Paul McCartney and George Harrison (lead guitarist) met in school, through riding the same bus. Eventually, Paul came across John Lennon and his band</p>
            <p> The Quarrymen. McCartney convinced George to show John his guitar skills, and eventually the three were all apart of the band. At first, their band had </p>
            <p>a different drummer, but they soon switched Pete Best out for Ringo Starr, and the rest is history </p>

        <h2> Natural Disaster </h2>
        <h3> By Elliot Smith </h3>
                                    <p><u>The Song</u></p>
            <p><u>The Artist</u></p>
            <p>Elliot Smith was an acoustic guitarist who lived most of his life in Portland, Oregon. He gained fame for being on the Good Will, Hunting Soundtrack.</p>
                <p>He also gained fame by performing Miss Misery at the Oscars. After these events, he gradually gained more acclaim through his hit song "Between the Bars.<p>
            <p>His success was abruptly ended by his death on October 21, 2003. Much speculation surrounds his death, as it was ruled a suicide</p>
        <p>However, not enough evidence has been brought to the public to determine whether or not he really did end his own life</p>
