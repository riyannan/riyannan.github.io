            <p>Day in the Life starts off where the last song on the record, "Sgt Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band", leaves off. Then a slew of piano comes in.
    The first verse is sang by John Lennon. He coveres a few tragic and/or dynamic events that had recently occured. He speaks about them from an outsider's 
             perspective, in an almost tongue-in cheek way. The highlight of this song is the orchestra. Reportedly, Lennon had instructed them to make it sound like 
             the world was ending. Hence, the existential undertone. When the second verse comes in, Paul opens with a much cheerier tone. But, similar to the first verse, it
             ends with the orchestral boom. There are several elements of this song that make it my favorite, but the most important one is the sheer experimentation
             that is used. Every line in the song is utilized and perfectly executed. It has an undertone of fear and the unknown, but is also oddly cheery. 
            <p><u>The Band</u></p>
            <p>The infamous Beatles were "banded" (; together in Liverpool, England through a course of events that can only be described as destiny. Paul McCartney and George Harrison (lead guitarist) met in school, through riding the same bus. Eventually, Paul came across John Lennon and his band
            The Quarrymen. McCartney convinced George to show John his guitar skills, and eventually the three were all apart of the band. At first, their band had
           a different drummer, but they soon switched Pete Best out for Ringo Starr, and the rest is history.</p>

        <h2 id="Second"> New Disaster </h2>
        <h3> By Elliot Smith </h3>
                                    <p><u>The Song</u></p>
        <p>This song starts out with a simple guitar melody. Then, Elliot talks about seeing the ghost of someone's smile, which indicates that he lost someone close
        to him. He talks about getting fed up with the ghost. He questions why the ghost is even there. He says, "now I wonder what it is you're after, Keeping company 
        with this disaster". He seems to think og himself as a wreck and does not understand the ghost's intentions. I do not know if this means that he does not trust
        this ghost or if he does not want to burden it. By the end of the song, he says "I told you man, I told you". This indicates that he disappointed the ghost in 
        some way. Then he proceeds to tell the ghost that this is what it gets for following him.</p>
     
      
        <p><u>The Artist</u></p>
            <p>Elliot Smith was an acoustic guitarist who lived most of his life in Portland, Oregon. He gained fame for being on the Good Will, Hunting Soundtrack.
             He also gained fame by performing Miss Misery at the Oscars. After these events, he gradually gained more acclaim through his hit song "Between the Bars.
            His success was abruptly ended by his death on October 21, 2003. Much speculation surrounds his death, as it was ruled a suicide.
        However, not enough evidence has been brought to the public to determine whether or not he really did end his own life</p>
